1 - General
  1.1) Find the most frequent integer in an array
  1.2) Find pairs in an integer array whose sum is equal to 10 (bonus: do it in linear time)
  1.3) Given 2 integer arrays, determine of the 2nd array is a rotated version of the 1st array. Ex. Original Array A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8} Rotated Array B={5,6,7,8,1,2,3}
  1.4) Write fibbonaci iteratively and recursively (bonus: use dynamic programming)
  1.5) Find the only element in an array that only occurs once.
  1.6) Find the common elements of 2 int arrays
  1.7) Implement binary search of a sorted array of integers
  1.8) Implement binary search in a rotated array (ex. {5,6,7,8,1,2,3})
  1.9) Use dynamic programming to find the first X prime numbers
  1.A) Write a function that prints out the binary form of an int
  1.B) Implement parseInt
  1.C) Implement squareroot function
  1.D) Implement an exponent function (bonus: now try in log(n) time)
  1.E) Write a multiply function that multiples 2 integers without using *
  1.F) HARD: Given a function rand5() that returns a random int between 0 and 5, implement rand7()
  1.10) HARD: Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of "islands of 1s" (e.g. groups of connecting 1s)
2 - Strings
  2.1) Find the first non-repeated character in a String
  2.2) Reverse a String iteratively and recursively
  2.3) Determine if 2 Strings are anagrams
  2.4) Check if String is a palindrome
  2.5) Check if a String is composed of all unique characters
  2.6) Determine if a String is an int or a double
  2.7) HARD: Find the shortest palindrome in a String
  2.8) HARD: Print all permutations of a String
  2.9) HARD: Given a single-line text String and a maximum width value, write the function 'String justify(String text, int maxWidth)' that formats the input text using full-justification, i.e., extra spaces on each line are equally distributed between the words; the first word on each line is flushed left and the last word on each line is flushed right
3 - Trees
  3.1) Implement a BST with insert and delete functions
  3.2) Print a tree using BFS and DFS
  3.3) Write a function that determines if a tree is a BST
  3.4) Find the smallest element in a BST
  3.5) Find the 2nd largest number in a BST
  3.6) Given a binary tree which is a sum tree (child nodes add to parent), write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree
  3.7) Find the distance between 2 nodes in a BST and a normal binary tree
  3.8) Print the coordinates of every node in a binary tree, where root is 0,0
  3.9) Print a tree by levels
  3.A) Given a binary tree which is a sum tree, write an algorithm to determine whether the tree is a valid sum tree
  3.B) Given a tree, verify that it contains a subtree.
  3.C) HARD: Find the max distance between 2 nodes in a BST.
  3.D) HARD: Construct a BST given the pre-order and in-order traversal Strings
4 - Stacks, Queues, and Heaps
  4.1) Implement a stack with push and pop functions
  4.2) Implement a queue with queue and dequeue functions
  4.3) Find the minimum element in a stack in O(1) time
5 - Write a function that sorts a stack (bonus: sort the stack in place without extra memory)
  5.1) Implement a binary min heap. Turn it into a binary max heap
  5.2) HARD: Implement a queue using 2 stacks
  5.3) Linked Lists
6 - Implement a linked list (with insert and delete functions)
  6.1) Find the Nth element in a linked list
  6.2) Remove the Nth element of a linked list
  6.3) Check if a linked list has cycles
  6.4) Given a circular linked list, find the node at the beginning of the loop. Example: A-->B-->C --> D-->E -->C, C is the node that begins the loop
  6.5) Check whether a link list is a palindrome
  6.6) Reverse a linked list iteratively and recursively
7 - Sorting
  7.1) Implement bubble sort
  7.2) Implement selection sort
  7.3) Implement insertion sort
  7.4) Implement merge sort
  7.5) Implement quick sort
